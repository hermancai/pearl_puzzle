# pearl_puzzle
An instance of the Pearl Puzzle using pygame

https://repl.it/@hermancai/CS325-Portfolio-Project#README.md


NOTES: 
- The project is hosted on Repl.it but it may be easier to run from a terminal.
- The puzzle is randomly generated by default. 
- Some randomly generated puzzles may be impossible to solve. Close and rerun main.py for a new puzzle.
- There is also a hardcoded instance by changing the constant 'RANDOM_GENERATOR' from True to False in /assets/constants.py
- An image of the hardcoded puzzle solution is available in this directory.
- Constants (screen dimensions and font sizes) have been changed to fit a repl.it screen.
- More constant values can be found and changed in /assets/constants.py


How to run from Repl.it:
https://repl.it/@hermancai/CS325-Portfolio-Project#README.md
- Click on 'Run' on top of the page.
- Repl.it may have trouble rendering the screen. Try refreshing the page or restarting the process multiple times.
- Repl.it may not work well on Chrome. Try another browser like Firefox.
- Wait for the pygame package to finish updating to version 2.0.0. The code will not work on an older version.
- A pygame window should appear above the python shell. 
- Interact with the pygame window. Repl.it may be slow to respond to interactions.


How to run from a Windows terminal:
- Download all files
- Have Python 3 installed
- Navigate to the directory containing main.py
- Type 'pip install pygame' and press Enter
- Type 'main.py' and press Enter
